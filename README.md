## Selected Topic 
Heart attack/failure prediction 

## Description of the source of data 
We will be using [Framingham Data](https://www.kaggle.com/dileep070/heart-disease-prediction-using-logistic-regression) and [Heart Attack Analysis ](https://www.kaggle.com/rashikrahmanpritom/heart-attack-analysis-prediction-dataset) to predict the outcomes 

## Introduction 
Heart disease has the highest mortality according to CDC data on death and mortality. Heart disease is a cluster of heart conditions which affect the flow of the blood to the heart leading to a heart attack or heart failure, and the key risk factors for heart disease include high blood pressure, smoking and high cholesterol. As the leading cause of death globally and in the United States, it is important to understand the most prevalent causes and preventative measures that one can take to avoid succumbing to heart disease.
