# Heart Study

## Presentation

### Selected Topic 
Heart attack/failure prediction 

### Introduction 
Heart disease has the highest mortality according to CDC data on death and mortality. Heart disease is a cluster of heart conditions which affect the flow of the blood to the heart leading to a heart attack or heart failure, and the key risk factors for heart disease include high blood pressure, smoking and high cholesterol. As the leading cause of death globally and in the United States, it is important to understand the most prevalent causes and preventative measures that one can take to avoid succumbing to heart disease.

### Source of Data
We will be using [Framingham Data](https://www.kaggle.com/dileep070/heart-disease-prediction-using-logistic-regression) and [Heart Attack Analysis ](https://www.kaggle.com/rashikrahmanpritom/heart-attack-analysis-prediction-dataset) to predict the outcomes

### Communication Plan
We plan on communicating using Slack and utilizing our class times on Tuesdays and Thursdays. We have also exchanged phone numbers in case of any emergencies.

### Outline

## Machine Learning Model

### Preliminary Data Preprocessing

### Preliminary Feature Engineering, Selection, Decision-Making Process

### Splitting Data

### Model Choice

## Database
We cleaned our data with Python Pandas here: [Cleaned_data.ipynb]() and connected it to our Postgres database with SQLAlchemy. Below is a picture of the ERD we used for both datasets:
