# Heart_Study

## Selected Topic 
Heart attack/failure prediction 

## Project Utilizations
For this project we will be exploring two datasets ,the Framingham Heart study which is one of the longest-running and most regarded heart disease studies, most accredited to its earliest findings of the correlation between high blood pressure, smoking, high cholesterol to heart disease. Supported by the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute, the study follows logistic regression to predict outcome and calculate the probability of success. Who is more susceptible to heart disease? Which factors are attributed? And we will also be using Heart Failure prediction dataset which explores mortality by heart failure through machine learning.

## Outcome
The goal of our machine learning model is to predict whether or not an individual will likely develop coronary heart disease, based on a multitude of factors including exercising, smoking, age, gender, education level, etc.
