## Prevalence and Causes of Heart Disease

###### Introduction
Heart disease has the highest mortality according to CDC data on death and mortality. Heart disease is a cluster of heart conditions which affect the flow of the blood to the heart leading to a heart attack or heart failure, and the key risk factors for heart disease include high blood pressure, smoking and high cholesterol. As the leading cause of death globally and in the United States, it is important to understand the most prevalent causes and preventative measures that one can take to avoid succumbing to heart disease.

(Add more details for the heart attack data set)For this project we will be exploring a dataset from the Framingham Heart study which is one of the longest-running and most regarded heart disease studies, most accredited to its earliest findings of the correlation between high blood pressure, smoking, high cholesterol to heart disease. Supported by the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute, the study follows logistic regression to predict outcome and calculate the probability of success. Who is more susceptible to heart disease? Which factors are attributed? 

## Outcome
The goal of our machine learning model is to predict whether or not an individual will likely develop coronary heart disease, based on a multitude of factors including exercising, smoking, age, gender, education level, etc.

## Communication Plan
We plan on communicating using Slack and utilizing our class times on Tuesdays and Thursdays. We have also exchanged phone numbers in case of any emergencies.

# Technologies Used
## Data Cleaning and Analysis
Pandas will be used to clean the data and perform an exploratory analysis. Further analysis will be completed using Python.

## Database Storage
Postgres SQL is the database we intend to use, and we will integrate Tableau to display the data.

## Machine Learning
We will be using the following modules and tools to create a linear regression model:
Google.colab
Sklearn.model_selection to import train_test_split 
sklearn.linear_model to import LogisticRegression
Sklearn.metrics to import accuracy_score
sklearn.metrics to import confusion_matrix, classification_report

## Dashboard
We will be using Tableau to create our interactive dashboard. It will be hosted on Tableau public.
